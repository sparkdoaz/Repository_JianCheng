 I've provided a base class Person in the editor below. Once an instance of Person is created, you can call fullName() and get a person's full name.
 
 
 Your job is to create a class named Doctor that overrides the fullName() method. Once you have a class definition, create an instance and assign it to a constant named someDoctor.
 
 
 For example, given the first name "Sam", and last name "Smith", calling fullName() on an instance of Person would return "Sam Smith", but calling the same method on an instance of Doctor would return "Dr. Smith".

In the editor below you have two objects - classes named Point and Robot. The Robot stores its location as a point instance and contains a move function.


The task of this challenge is to complete the implementation for move. Move takes a parameter of type Direction which is an enumeration listing the possible movement directions.


When you tell the robot to move up (by specifying Direction.Up as the argument), the y coordinate should increase by 1. Similarly moving down means the y coordinate decreases by 1, moving right means the x coordinate increases by 1 and finally left means x decreases by 1.

 Next, add a method to the enum named button that returns an instance of the class UIBarButtonItem configured properly. An example of how to create an instance for this task is shown in the comments below. Use the same initializer.
 
 
 In the method, using the associated values as titles for the button, return a button with style UIBarButtonStyle.done for the done member of the BarButton enum. Similarly for the edit member, return a UIBarButtonItem instance with the style set to UIBarButtonStyle.plain.
 
 
 In both cases you can pass nil for target and action. Once you have a method, call it on the value we created in the previous task and assign it to a constant named button.
